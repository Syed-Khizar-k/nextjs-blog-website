# Introduction

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build server-side rendered applications with ease. It provides a robust set of features that enhance the development experience and improve performance. In this blog post, we will explore the fundamentals of Next.js, its key features, and how to get started with building your first application.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source framework built on top of React. It allows developers to create static and dynamic web applications with minimal configuration. One of the standout features of Next.js is its ability to perform server-side rendering (SSR), which can significantly improve the performance and SEO of your web applications.

## Key Features of Next.js

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js allows you to render pages on the server, which can lead to faster load times and better SEO.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can pre-render pages at build time, which is ideal for content that doesnâ€™t change often.

3. **API Routes**: Next.js provides a way to create API endpoints within your application, making it easy to handle backend logic.

4. **File-Based Routing**: The framework uses a file-based routing system, which simplifies the process of creating routes for your application.

5. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits your code, ensuring that users only load the necessary JavaScript for the page they are visiting.

## Getting Started with Next.js

To get started with Next.js, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js set up, you can create a new Next.js application by running the following command in your terminal:
